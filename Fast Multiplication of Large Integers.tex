\textbf{Fast Multiplication of Large Numbers.} An algorithm is given for computing the product of two $N$-digit binary numbers by $O(N \lg N \lg \lg N)$. Two ways of implementing the algorithm are considered: multitape Turing machines and logical nets (with step = binary logical element.)

\section{Introduction}

The school method for multiplying two decimal numbers can be easily adapted for the multiplication of $N$-digit binary numbers using a Turing machine with multiple tapes or in a logical network (constructed from two-digit logical elements). In both cases, the computational effort is of the order of $N$. Here, we define the effort of a network as the number of its elements.

For a Turing machine that performs multiplication of numbers of arbitrary length, the effort of multiplying N-digit numbers is defined as the maximum number of head movements over all input pairs of length $N$.

The prevailing and intuitively plausible belief that the effort required by the school method cannot be significantly reduced was refuted in 1962 by A.\ Karatsuba \cite{karatsuba}, who constructed a network with
\[
O\left(N^{\lg 3}\right)
\]
elements ($\lg 3 \approx 1.58$). The method easily extends to Turing machines without difficulty.
